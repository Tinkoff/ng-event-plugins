<h2>Example</h2>
<p class="flex">
    <custom-select [items]="items"></custom-select>
    <button (click)="onOpened()">Show popup</button>
</p>
<blockquote>
    When you mouse over an option in a dropdown — it gets focused. You can then use arrows to move focus to another
    item, keeping mouse hovering over previously focused element.
    <p>
        When you move your cursor — that item is focused again. You can see this behavior in virtually every dropdown
        menu both in OS and inside browser. Reacting to every
        <code>mousemove</code>
        event is unnecessary, because when item is already focused, you do not need to do anything and there is no need
        to trigger change detection.

    <code>@tinkoff/ng-event-plugins</code>
    allows you to skip events using
    <code>.silent</code>
    event modifier and
    <code>@shouldCall</code>
    decorator. It also adds
    <code>.stop</code>
    and
    <code>.prevent</code>
    event modifiers to prevent default and stop propagation in declarative fashion. And
    <code>.capture</code>
    modifier to listen to events in capture phase.

    Keep in mind example is heavily simplified. To use AOT all filtering functions must be exported named functions and
    arguments number must match.

<popup *ngIf="popup" (closed)="onClosed()">
    <h1>Popup</h1>
    <custom-select [items]="items"></custom-select>
    <blockquote>
        When Esc button is pressed, popup should close. However, if dropdown is opened in Select — Esc button should
        only close the dropdown. This can be achieved by stopping event propagation. But if the dropdown is already
        closed, Select should not handle Esc keydown event. This can be achieved using
        <code>@shouldCall</code>
        decorator.

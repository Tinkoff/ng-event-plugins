**@tinkoff/ng-event-plugins** is a tiny (1KB gzip) library for
optimizing change detection cycles for performance sensitive events
(such as _touchmove_, _scroll_, _drag_ etc.) and declarative
_preventDefault()_ and _stopPropagation()_.

## How to use

1. Add `EventPluginsModule` to your app module:

    ```typescript
    import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
    import {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import {EventPluginsModule} from '@tinkoff/ng-event-plugins'; // <-- THIS

    @NgModule({
        bootstrap: [
            /*...*/
        ],
        imports: [
            /*...*/
            BrowserModule,
            EventPluginsModule, // <-- GOES HERE
        ],
        declarations: [
            /*...*/
        ],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

> `BrowserModule` or `BrowserAnimationsModule` must go first. You will see a warning if you mess the order.

2. Use new modifiers for events in templates and in `@HostListener`:

    - `.stop` to call stopPropagation() on event
    - `.prevent` to call preventDefault() on event
    - `.self` to skip bubbled events
    - `.silent` to call event handler outside Angular's `NgZone`
    - `.capture` to listen to events in [capture phase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/eventPhase)

    For example:

    ```html
    <div (mousedown.prevent)="onMouseDown()">
        Clicking on this DIV will not move focus
    </div>
    ```

    ```html
    <div (click.stop)="onClick()">Clicks on this DIV will not bubble up</div>
    ```

    ```html
    <div (mousemove.silent)="onMouseMove()">
        Callbacks to mousemove will not trigger change detection
    </div>
    ```

    ```html
    <div (click.capture.stop)="onClick()">
        <div (click)="never()">Clicks will be stopped before reaching this DIV</div>
    </div>
    ```

3. You can also re-enter `NgZone` and trigger change detection, using `@shouldCall` decorator
   that takes a predicate function as argument:

```html
<div (scroll.silent)="onScroll($event.currentTarget)">
    Scrolling this DIV will only trigger change detection and onScroll callback if it is
    scrolled to bottom
</div>
```

```typescript
import {HostListener} from '@angular/core';
import {shouldCall} from '@tinkoff/ng-event-plugins';

export function scrollFilter(element: HTMLElement): boolean {
    return element.scrollTop === element.scrollHeight - element.clientHeight;
}

// ...

@shouldCall(scrollFilter)
@HostListener('init.onScroll', ['$event'])
onScroll(_element: HTMLElement) {
    this.someService.requestMoreData();
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** You must couple `@shouldCall` with `@HostListener` for `init` event
as shown above until `markDirty` becomes public API in Angular and **@tinkoff/ng-event-plugins** v.3 is released

> All examples above work the same when used with `@HostListener` and `CustomEvent`

### Important notes

-   Predicate is called with the same arguments as the decorated method and
    in the context of class instance (has access to `this`)

-   Decorated method will be called and change detection triggered if predicate
    returns `true`.

-   Predicates must be exported named function for AOT, arrow
    functions will trigger build error.

-   `.silent` modifier will not work with built-in keyboard pseudo-events,
    such as `keydown.enter` or `keydown.arrowDown` since Angular re-enters `NgZone`
    inside internal handlers.

## Observable host bindings

In this library there's also a plugin that enables observable
host bindings. Sounds weird to do host binding with event plugin,
but the code is actually pretty simple. You can read more about it
in this article [link coming soon].

To use it you need to couple `@HostListener` and `@HostBinding` on the same
`Observable` property with following syntax:

```ts
@HostBinding('$.disabled')
@HostListener('$.disabled')
readonly disabled$ = asCallable(this.service.loading$)
```

This supports all the native Angular syntax, such as `class.class-name` or `style.width.px`.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

-   Until [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12045) is resolved you would have to use `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` in your module in order to bind to arbitrary properties
-   `asCallable` is a utility function from this library that simply adds `Function` to the type so Angular thinks it could be a host listener
-   To bind attributes you need to add `.attr` modifier in the end, not the beginning like
    in basic Angular binding. This is due to Angular using regexp to match for `attr.` string in `@HostBinding`
    decorator:

```ts
@HostBinding('$.aria-label.attr')
@HostListener('$.aria-label.attr')
readonly label$ = asCallable(this.translations.get$('label'));
```
